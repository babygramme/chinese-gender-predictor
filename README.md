# Chinese Calendar Gender Predictor

The Chinese Calendar Gender Predictor is an ancient method to find out the sex of your baby with [an accuracy of 50%](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(09)01545-2/fulltext).

This code is used mostly as a joke on [this page](https://www.babygram.me/chinese-gender-predictor). If you are looking for science based gender prediction, better use [nub theory](https://www.babygram.me/nub-theory) or even [machine learning](https://www.babygram.me/how-it-works).
